# Rust Project Setup Guide

## Step 1: Download and Install Rust Rover
1. **Download Rust Rover**:
   * Go to the **JetBrains Rust Rover download page**
   * Download and install the appropriate version for your operating system

## Step 2: Download and Install LLVM
1. **Download LLVM**:
   * Go to the **LLVM 1.8.1 release page**
   * Download the appropriate version for your operating system
   * Follow the installation instructions provided on the release page

## Step 3: Set Up a Rust Project in Rust Rover
1. **Open Rust Rover**:
   * Launch Rust Rover

2. **Create a New Rust Project**:
   * Go to `File` > `New` > `Project`
   * Select `Rust` and follow the prompts to create a new Rust project
   * When prompted, download and install `rustup` and its linker as recommended

## Step 4: Copy Backend Files
1. **Copy Cargo.toml**:
   * Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your new Rust project
   * Replace the contents starting from `[dependencies]` to the end with the provided `Cargo.toml` content

2. **Copy main.rs**:
   * Open the `src/main.rs` file in your new Rust project
   * Replace the contents with the provided `main.rs` content

## Step 5: Run the Backend Server
1. **Build and Run the Project**:
   * In Rust Rover, click on the `Run` button or use the terminal to run `cargo run`
   * This will download the required dependencies, build the project, and start the backend server locally

## Step 6: Open the Frontend
1. **Open index.html**:
   * Navigate to the `frontend` directory
   * Open `index.html` in your web browser

## Step 7: Process Excel Files
1. **Use the Frontend**:
   * Follow the instructions on the frontend to upload Excel files
